You really just need an authorized_keys file.

```
$ ssh-keygen -b 4066 -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/MyUsrname/.ssh/id_rsa): ./id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ./id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in ./id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rYc5XdV9E8WibZ7wQLWFkfIP9bNmdSbmLheXRuVryKM MyUsrname@MyMachineName
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4066]----+
